   <h2>What IS hair type ?</h2>
   <p>Hair type is the overall shape of your hair, going from super super straight ... to super super curly. These shapes are catergorized into 4 different groups, 1 2 3 and 4. and just to make it even more specific, there are subcategories within those groups. A B and C. All of this is based on the curl pattern, density, porosity, and more.</p>

<h3>MY hair type !!!</h3>

<p>
    I personally have a mix of 2B and 2C type hair, with a few 3A thrown in there. For some reason, the bottom layer of my hair is straight and refuses to curl. Why? I have no idea and it’s pretty annoying but it’s okay because I still have the rest of my curls that actually show :) Fun fact, I used to have very straight hair as a little kid, but when I got to around the age of 15 my hair started to grow really wavy at the root…But only in the front…So for a good 5 months I looked like Princess Leia from Star Wars. This is what initially sparked my interest in hair care. I was tired of straightening my hair every day and just really wanted to find out why my hair changed so suddenly. After spending way too many hours on the internet searching for facts and products I was able to properly take care of my hair. Eventually, the waves spread to the rest of my head, and over time it got even wavier. Because of this I fell in love with my hair and hair care in general.
